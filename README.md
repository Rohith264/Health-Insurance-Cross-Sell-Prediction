# Health-Insurance-Cross-Sell-Prediction

As part of Health Insurance Cross Sell Prediction project, I wanted to predict whether current potential health insurance policyholders will also be interested in the vehicle insurance that the company is trying to launch. The audience is the marketing executive of the insurance company who is interested in targeting customer segments for vehicle insurance provided by the company. Prediction will help to target the existing health insurance customers who are interested in the vehicle insurance as well with effective communication strategy and will also help in optimizing the business model to provide exciting offers for them. From exploratory data analysis, we were able to find out that males at the age between 35~55 who live in region 28 & 8, have not purchased insurance for their 1-2 years old car yet that had accidents before would be more interested in purchasing insurance.

The outcome variable is the Response variable which indicates whether the customer is interested in vehicle insurance of the company or not. (1- Interested 0- Not interested).
Gender, Age, Driving_Licence, Region_Code, Previously_insured, Vehicle_Age, Vehicle_Damage, Annual_Premium, Policy_sales_channel as the predictors I'll be using for modelling and Random Forest, Logistic Regression, KNN, Decision Tree and SVM  are the statistical models that I have used for predicting potential customers
